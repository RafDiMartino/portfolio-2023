# Personal Portfolio Site

Welcome to my personal portfolio site, built with Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind, GSAP, and PWA. I'm a web developer with a passion for building beautiful and user-friendly websites.

On this site, you'll find a collection of all my projects, as well as information about my skills and experience. I'm always looking for new challenges, so if you have a project in mind, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Made with:

- Next.js
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- GSAP
- PWA

This site is always evolving, as I'm constantly learning new things and adding new features. I hope you'll come back often to see what's new.
